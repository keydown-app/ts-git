 * Word-level diff for prose across files.
 * Detects word additions/removals and sentence moves between files.
 *
 * This package provides both:
 * 1. A line diff algorithm interface (wordsLineDiff) for use with ts-git's diff command
 * 2. A project-wide diff function (diffProject) for analyzing changes across multiple files
 *
 * Install with:
 *   npm install @keydown-app/ts-git-diff-words
 *
 * Planned features:
 * - Word-level tokenization and diffing
 * - Sentence/paragraph move detection within a file
 * - Cross-file sentence/paragraph move detection
 * - Smart handling of reordered content (not counting as add/delete)
 *
 * @throws Error Not yet implemented
